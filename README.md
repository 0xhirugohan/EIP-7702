# EIP-7702 Casual Hackathon

**Account Abstraction** is becoming one of the most transformative topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. The introduction of **EIP-7702** marks a pragmatic and visionary step forward in this domain.

We believe that meaningful innovation doesn’t always come from boardrooms or conference stages — it often starts with a late-night hack or a sudden spark in your code editor.

Bring your creativity, code, and maybe a cup of iced coffee — and help shape the next chapter of Account Abstraction.

## 🌿 What is Casual Hackathon?

Low-cost, casual hackathons that let anyone revel in the pure joy of creating — and spark real innovation in return. Casual Hackathon is an open-source public good created by LXDAO.

### ✨ Core Principles

- **Lightweight operation**: Online-first, casual participation, no pressure — extremely low operational overhead.
- **Open-source public good**: Fully open-source with no patent restrictions; any group can adopt or fork it.
- **De-commercialized**: No mandatory prize pools or sponsor KPIs — bounty hunters stay away, creativity comes first.
- **Relaxed participation**: No forced all-nighters or on-site attendance; health and enjoyment matter.
- **Everyone wins**: Judges present a unique award to every project, giving all ideas their moment.
- **Curated themes**: Carefully curated prompts that spark imagination and encourage playful, cutting-edge development

## ✍️ How to Participate

   - Add your participant details to `[your-github-id].md` (please do not edit `template.md`)
   - Submit a PR — once merged, you’re officially registered 🎉

2. **How to Build**

   - Fork the repo and clone it locally
   - Create a folder under `/demos` for your project
   - Start building your magic within your project folder (please do not edit others' folder) 🧙‍♂️

3. **How to Submit**

   - When done, submit a PR with your project before the Demo day deadline
   - Make sure your project folder includes a `README.md`
   - Add your project details to the `README.md`, please follow the [demo template](./demos/template.md) for consistency

## 👨‍💻 Who Should Join?

This isn’t a bootcamp for beginners — it’s a high-bar, low-ego hackathon designed for:

- Protocol Engineers
- Solidity / Vyper Developers
- Wallet Builders
- Security Researchers
- Anyone deeply curious about Account Abstraction

If you’re ready to:

- Dive deep into a chosen EIP and build production-ready apps around it.
- Turn abstract concepts into working code that showcases the latest Ethereum features.

**This hackathon is for you.**

## 🧩 Why 7702? Why Now?

**EIP-7702** addresses key limitations of **EIP-3074** while preserving its core strength: temporarily turning EOAs into smart accounts.

Key benefits:

- ✅ **Backwards-compatible** (works alongside ERC-4337)
- ✅ **Highly extensible** (supports custom validation logic)
- ✅ **Improved security model** (avoids permanent delegation risks)

This isn’t just a fix — it’s a new design space for wallets, dApps, security, identity, and permissions.

**Now** is the time to build, test, question, and innovate — hands-on, from the ground up.
