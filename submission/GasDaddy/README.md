## Description

GasDaddy is a novel solution built on EIP-7702 that addresses the common challenge of executing transactions on a new blockchain without having native gas tokens. Here's how it works:

1. When you want to interact with a smart contract on a new chain but lack gas tokens, GasDaddy allows you to generate an authorization request or transaction.
2. You can share this request with your friends or community members through a simple link or message.
3. These "Gas Daddies" can then execute the transaction on your behalf, effectively sponsoring the gas fees for your operation.
4. As a fun twist, by helping you with gas, they earn the honorary title of "Gas Daddy" - a playful way to acknowledge their support.

This solution makes it easier for users to get started on new chains and encourages community support through a lighthearted, gamified approach to gas sponsorship.
