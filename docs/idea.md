# 💡 EIP-7702: Idea Pool

Here are some creative ideas for building with EIP-7702. Feel free to contribute—even if you’re not planning to implement them. This is a space for open exploration and inspiration.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Most wallets (e.g., MetaMask) currently don’t support sending custom Type 4 transactions. For example, MetaMask only supports switching to their own audited Smart Account implementation. This means some ideas below may not be usable in production dapps yet—but you can still experiment in test environments or with custom scripts.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Wallet UX Improvements

- **Instant-Upgrade Wallet**
  Select the Smart Account contract you prefer, sign a single transaction, and instantly upgrade your EOA into a feature-rich smart account.

- **7702-Based Social Recovery**
  Enable social recovery for your EOA using delegated smart contracts—no more fear of losing access due to private key loss.

---

## 💸 DeFi & Payments

- **Subscription Signer**
  Authorize a dapp to spend a capped amount (e.g., 5 USDC/week) via a 7702 session key. A secure and flexible on-chain subscription model.

---

## 🎮 Gaming

- **Mecha Suit Loadout**
  Deploy multiple "Mecha Suit" contracts with different capabilities. Choose and switch into the one that best fits your battle strategy.

---

## 🛡️ Security

- **Fund Rescuer**
  Recover assets from a compromised EOA using a paymaster and a trusted delegator.

## 🛠️ Developer Tools

- **7702 Management Portal**
  A dashboard for managing your 7702-linked smart accounts—view, audit, revoke, or upgrade delegated contracts from your EOA.
