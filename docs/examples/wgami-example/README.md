This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi).

Use it to build web app for EIP-7702.

For the record: This isn’t working yet due to current wallet limitations. Most wallets, like MetaMask, don’t support sending custom Type 4 transactions. For example, MetaMask only allows switching to their Smart Account feature, which uses their own audited Smart Account contract.

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
